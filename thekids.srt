1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,820
弟兒小時候很搗蛋
Dale was a mischievous child and very vain

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,900
- 很愛漂亮
- 很愛漂亮

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,340
他，每一個大的孩子他也跟人家玩
He got along with everyone,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,620
小的孩子也跟他
older and younger kids alike

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,620
非常非常的活潑
He was very outgoing and vivacious 

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,140
他要開舞會
One time he wanted to host a dance party

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
那個時候，台灣
Taiwan was a very regimented society then

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,740
學生開舞會還要申請
Students needed to apply with the local police

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,300
媽媽跟他跑警察局
so Mom went with him to the police station

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,160
申請，還要找地方
and found a venue for the party

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,380
找舞會的場所
where they could dance

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,700
呂台明從小就是很乖
Tai was a very sweet child 

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,980
而且是很懶
and particularly lazy

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,580
因為他
He really liked to be held, by everyone

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,520
每個小孩，你抱他


16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,220
抱著他時候他就會很高興
Nothing made him happier than to be held

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,220
可是你把他抱久的時候
But if you held him for a long time, 

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,440
他就不高興了
he would become irritated

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,180
那你把他放下來
Then if you put him down

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,780
放下來放在椅子上，或放在床上
on a chair or in a bed

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,400
他馬上就笑了
He would immediately smile

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,100
他就不舒服了
He didn't like to be uncomfortable

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
他就要舒服
Comfort was very important to him

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,540
而且，從小的時候就怕死
He also had a tremendous fear of death

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,300
每天要叫爸爸給他找那個
Everyday he would ask Dad to find him

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,940
長生不老藥
the elixir that would guarantee eternal life

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,820
要吃長生不老藥
He needed the elixir 

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
結果，逼得爸爸没辦法
In the end Dad came up with a plan

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,340
從香港回來時候就弄一個維他命丸給他吃
and brought home vitamins from Hong Kong

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,140
吃了之後他就不怕死了
The placebo effect worked like a charm

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,780
以前他很怕死
And then he was no longer afraid of dying

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,420
說妳從小
Anchi was a very healthy baby

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,200
生下來的時候
She never got sick, she was our little "Iron Girl"

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,300
身體很好

35
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,740
身體好，是小鐵人

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,380
但是脾氣壞得不得了
But oh my did she have a temper

37
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,980
那我就說
when I made her formula 

38
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,820
「馬上給你沖啊，馬上來了！」I
would have to say, it's coming

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,880
- 「快了！快了！」 the bottle is coming
-
一直叫一直叫

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,800
想再吃就生氣了
otherwise she would get very angry

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
假設

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,900
假設沖了比較慢的話，你就生氣
Suppose we were a little late with 

43
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
就不吃了
getting the bottle to her, she would then refuse to drink it

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
安琪才三歲
When Anchi was just three 

45
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,920
把姑媽氣了個半死
she was already a force to be reckoned with

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,260
那個梁媽媽給你取了個名字叫
One of our friends called her 

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,660
戳心子
"the one who pierced hearts"

48
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,880
專門戳人家心
She was adept at hitting your pain spot

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,140
為什麼我會這麼直的個性呢？Why
was I like this?

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,540
對啊
Yeah

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,320
不知道為什麼
we have no idea!

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,220
像誰呢？Who
do I resemble?

53
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,320
不知道，可能是像你奶奶吧
I don't know, maybe your paternal grandmother?

54
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,080
像奶奶，可能像奶奶
Yes, I think like your grandma

55
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,300
奶奶的脾氣也很壞
Your grandma also had quite a temper

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,680
我的
My seven grandchildren

57
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,820
七個孫子

58
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,940
最大的叫「Alan」The
eldest is Alan

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,960
這個孩子
Alan is very pragmatic

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,000
他是很現實的

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,320
他每天說我要多賺錢
Everyday he told me he wanted to make a lot of money

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,000
中間他就
He changed jobs and studied for his Masters 

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
辭掉了工作
in Financial Engineering at UCLA

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,840
去讀碩士


65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,720
就修經濟這行

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
所以他現在畢業了
Now he has graduated and works at a bank (PIMCO)

67
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,840
找到了銀行的工作

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
他從小
He was raised by his maternal grandmother Popo

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,940
是由婆婆養大他的
Popo adored him 

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,420
那個婆婆非常愛他
They spent a lot of time together

71
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,380
因為在一起生活的時間很久
and he is always very kind to her

72
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,200
他對婆婆很好

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
老二
Our second grandson is Evan

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,820

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,620
他呢
Evan is a very honest boy

76
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,620
原來很老實的


77
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,780
不多講話
He is not chatty and is rather introverted 

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,480
是很內向的

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,200
大學畢業以後讀碩士
After he graduated from college he pursed his

80
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,980
碩士完了繼續讀博士
Masters and then a PhD degree

81
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,380
他最後的目的就是
I think his goal is to become a college professor

82
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,180
做一個大學教授

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,340

他比較外向
Ryan is an extrovert 

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,980
功課還不錯
He is a good student but he doesn't apply himself 

87
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,840
可是他不用功讀書
as well as he can

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
哩哩拉拉的
It took him a while and he finally graduated

89
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,220
終於大學畢業了

90
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,400
可是他
But instead of looking for a stable job he swung between

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
没有好好去找工作

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,860
一會兒要去台灣教英文
teaching English in Taiwan or in China

93
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,640
一會兒也想去大陸教英文

94
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
我看他
The way I see it is that he's not focused on teaching English

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
不是教英文

96
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,120
他

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,340
教課没教很久

98
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,880
但是他女朋友就是一大堆
but more on meeting girls

99
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,760

從小就媽媽帶大的
Nainai brought him up so he is very close to her

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,560
所以他跟媽媽的感情

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,740
兩個人的感情都好得不得了
They love each other very much

109

她懂得怎麼樣騙人，怎麼樣哄人
She knows how to butter you up 

126

關於人際關係，她會察顏觀色
and she is good at reading people

127
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,720
她會騙你，讓你很舒服
She tells little white lies to make you feel good

128
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,160
我們家 We have a very happy family 

129
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,420
可以說是很幸福

130
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,600
這些都是媽媽的功勞
and this is all possible because of Mom

131
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
媽媽從小帶你們
Mom took care of all of you tirelessly

愛你們

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,480
可是很辛苦 She has put in a lot of effort 

135
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,100
你們長大了
Now you're all grown and she's old

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,500
可是她卻老了

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,340
但是她心裡還是很安慰
but she is content and comforted

138
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,840
我們雖然老了，可是我們心裡
While we have aged we are very happy

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
還是非常的愉快

140
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
