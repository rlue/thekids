弟兒小時候很搗蛋

他，每一個大的孩子他也跟人家玩
He got along with all the other kids,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,620

非常非常的活潑
He was so outgoing and vivacious.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,140
他要開舞會
This one time,
he wanted to throw a dance party,

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
那個時候，台灣
but in those days, in Taiwan,

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,740
學生開舞會還要申請
you needed a permit for that.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,300
媽媽跟他跑警察局
So Mom took him down
to the police station

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,160
申請，還要找地方
to fill out the application,
and even helped him

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,380
找舞會的場所
book a venue for the party.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,700
呂台明從小就是很乖
Tai was a very sweet child.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,980
而且是很懶
but also finicky.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,580
因為他
I mean,

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,520
每個小孩，你抱他
like all kids, he loved to be held.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,220
抱著他時候他就會很高興
Nothing made him happier.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,220
可是你把他抱久的時候
But if you held him for too long,

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,440
他就不高興了
he’d get all cranky.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,180
那你把他放下來
So you’d set him down

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,780
放下來放在椅子上，或放在床上
on a chair or the bed,

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,400
他馬上就笑了
and just like that,
he’d be smiling again.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,100
他就不舒服了
He knew what he didn’t like.

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
他就要舒服
He just wanted to be comfy.

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,540
而且，從小的時候就怕死
Even as a child, he was scared of death.

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,300
每天要叫爸爸給他找那個
Every day, he would ask Dad to find him

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,940
長生不老藥
the Elixir of Eternal Youth.

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,820
要吃長生不老藥
He just had to have it.

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
結果，逼得爸爸没辦法
What was Dad supposed to do?

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,340
從香港回來時候就弄一個維他命丸給他吃
So he brought home some vitamins
from a trip to Hong Kong,

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,140
吃了之後他就不怕死了
gave them to him, and poof–
his fear of death was gone.

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,780
以前他很怕死
He used to be so scared of it.

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,420
說妳從小
As for you,

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,200
生下來的時候

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,300
身體很好
you were always healthy.

35
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,740
身體好，是小鐵人
You never got sick.
You were a little Woman of Steel.

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,380
但是脾氣壞得不得了
But oh my did you have a temper.

37
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,980
那我就說
I used to shout,

38
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,820
「馬上給你沖啊，馬上來了！」
“It’s coming,
your formula is on the way!”

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,880
- 「快了！快了！」
  “Almost! Almost!”
- 一直叫一直叫
  Just hollering and hollering.

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,800
想再吃就生氣了
You’d get so upset having to wait for it.

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
假設
If

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,900
假設沖了比較慢的話，妳就生氣
If we took too long to make it,
you’d throw a fuss.

43
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
就不吃了
You wouldn’t want it anymore.

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
安琪才三歲
When Anchi was only three,

45
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,920
把姑媽氣了個半死
she used to drive her aunt up the wall.

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,260
那個梁媽媽給妳取了個名字叫
One of our friends
had a nickname for you:

00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,880
專門戳人家心
Your specialty was
finding people’s weak spots.

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,140
為什麼我會這麼直的個性呢？

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,540
對啊
Yeah,

51

像誰呢？
Who did I get that from?

53

不知道，可能是像你奶奶吧
I don’t know, maybe your nainai?

54
